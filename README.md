# Exercism TypeScript Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises completed on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript).  
These exercises help reinforce core programming concepts and language-specific features through hands-on practice.

## Structure

Each exercise is organized in its own folder containing the solution files.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a way to:

- Practice and improve programming language skills  
- Track progress on Exercism problems  
- Keep a personal reference for coding challenges

## Notes

Solutions represent my understanding at the time of completion.
